It is a custom [StableswapRAI.vy](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/curve-contract/blob/d52df33144d9d90aed099146cf354b5b40225653/contracts/pools/rai/StableSwapRAI.vy) implementation by the Reflexer Labs team, in collaboration with curve-core devs.\n",

    "The StableSwapRAI implementation has also been [audited by Quantstamp](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/reflexer-rai-curve-pool). It's a ver interesting audit report because it begins with QuantStamp suggesting that the code they audited is written in Solidity, but the code is actually written in Vyper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of audits: There are two points to consider.\n",
    "1. QuantStamp discovered that the compiler version used for the contract was not the latest (at that time: 0.3.0) and recommended an upgrade: to which, Reflexer Labs acknowledged the risk and did not upgrade the compiler version. The reasoning was: curve already uses the older vyper version to secure billions of TVL (most of curve's TVL is probably secured by the older version), and hence there was no need to change something which had already proven itself in production.\n",
    "2. The redemption price used by StableSwapRAI.vy contract uses an older version of the RAI Redemption Price. The more accurate method would be to first update the price using the [updateAndGetSnappedPrice() method from RedemptionPriceSnap.sol](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-redemption-price-snap/blob/abbea26ee0c3957a99dc93e0cd3c0ea4755bf069/src/RedemptionPriceSnap.sol#L104) or use the [Chainlink Oracle for the Redemption Price](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/ef7c7f20d047dd0fe8b7dc4cb24f4d5f1c7a04dd/src/single/OracleRelayer.sol#L265) before the price is called by any of the methods in the contract. Reflexer Labs core team decided to acknowledge and not act upon this suggestion as the redemption price does not fluctuate that much (data from contract: [RedemptionPriceSnap](https://etherscan.io/address/0x07210B8871073228626AB79c296d9b22238f63cE))\n",
    "\n",
    "![](plots/redemption_price_snap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The other limitation of using an update-and-then-use the redemption price method is the gas costs involved. The team expects that LPs and traders with high value transactions may want to consider calling [updateAndGetSnappedPrice](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-redemption-price-snap/blob/abbea26ee0c3957a99dc93e0cd3c0ea4755bf069/src/RedemptionPriceSnap.sol#L104) to update the RedemptionPrice snapshot contract to the latest value before large liquidity events.\n",

    "This is an interesting pre-condition to LP-ing or considering large swaps between RAI and 3CRV (socialised RedemptionPriceSnap updates!).

    "\n",
    "1. RAI is a over-collateralised asset (ETH), having stood the test of time (200+ days old project, which in defi years can be eons) through various market crashes (including a 50% drop in ETH prices in 2021). RAI hovers around 3 dollars in its value.\n",
    "2. Reflexer Labs has a multisig that controls virtually everything in their GEB system: in mid August 2022, this will go down drastically.\n",
    "3. The curve pool implementation was a collaboration between curve-core devs and Reflexer Labs devs, and has been audited by QuantStamp with two issues, one high risk and one medium: these issues in retrospect seem to not be too much of a hassle. The contracts are based on foundational contracts that have stood the test of time. Traders and LPs using the contract for very large transactions (add, remove, swap liquidity) may want to update redemption price before using the pool.\n",
    "4. RAI is a very interesting project, and deserves a gauge.\n",

    "**NOTE TO AGGREGATORS AND INTEGRATORS**\n",
    "Consider looking into the delta between redemption price snapshot and the system redemption price before adding, removing or swapping liquidity. This may help get your users the right prices for large liquidity events."
